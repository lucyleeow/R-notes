## Introduction

The general syntax of a ggplot2 call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>,    #statistical transformation
     position = <POSITION>) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

There are 7 parameters to specify but you will rarely have to specify all 7 parameters as ggplot has useful defaults.

### geoms

Different types of graphs are called different 'geoms', as they can be thought of geometrical objects used to represent data. E.g.:

* geom_bar = bar graph
* geom_line = line graph
* geom_boxplot = box plot        
* geom_point = scatter plot
* geom_smooth = smooth line fitted to the data

### Layering

Think of ggplot2 as creating a plot using layers. Here is a simple scatter plot: 
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

We can break this down into 'layers'.

This creates an empty graph:
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)
```

geom_point() creates a scatter plot on top of the empty base. 'mapping' is an argument you beed to define. It maps variable to a way to show it on graph or 'defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties'.

Mapping is always paired with aes() and the x and y arguments of aes(), which specify which variable is x and which one is y. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### Aesthetics

The specific `mapping = aes()` options vary depending on the type of geom. For geom_point, the following mapping options are available:

* colour - colour of the points.
* size - where each dot will be different sizes depending on the class it belongs to. You can also control the min and max range of point sizes with: `scale_size_continuous/discrete(range = c(2,4))` - depending on whether the variable is continuous or discrete.
* alpha - transparency of points.
* shape - shape of the points. ggplot2 will only use 6 shapes at a time. By default additional groups will be unplotted

A different variable can be mapped to each of these aesthetics. ggplot selects a reasonable scale and constructs a legend.

(The dataset `mpg` will be used in this section)

Here colour is mapped to the variable (column) class.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
```

You can also set aesthetics manually. Do this by mapping aesthetic name *outside of* the `aes()` function.

This makes all the points blue:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour = "blue")
```

* size - you can specify size of all points in mm
* shape - specify using a number code. The shapes available are:
![](Images/shapes-1.png)
* stroke - for shapes that have a border, this dictates the size of the border, in mm. 

Here we add a border to all the points:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(colour = "black", shape = 21, stroke = 1, size = 4, 
             aes(fill = factor(drv)))
```

It is important to note the difference between mapping an aesthetic within `aes()` and outside of `aes()` - 

* within `aes()` you can map a *variable* (or column) to an aesthetic
* outside of `aes()` (but inside a `geom`) you can only map an aesthetic to a *constant value*

(See [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41863049/when-does-the-aesthetic-go-inside-or-outside-aes) for more details)


### Syntax

If you put mappings at the top in ggplot(), it will use such mapping for everything, ‘global mapping’.

Here the same y and x mappings are used to create points and a smooth line.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

The above code means the same as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

You can still change mappings for specific geoms, even if you have specified a 'global' mapping in `ggplot()` call. If you add mappings to `geom_xx()`, ggplot2 will overwrite or extend the global mappings given in ggplot() with the local mappings given in geom_xx(). Again we can consider geom() as another layer underneath ggplot(), and any changes are for the layer geom(). 
Here, we add the colour variable to just the `geom_point()` layer.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

You can also simplify the syntax as `data =` and `mapping =` are the first arguments to the `ggplot()` and `geom_xx()` functions. 

### Stat

Stat stands for statistical transform and is the algorithm used by a geom  to calculate the values used for the graphs. You can find the default stat by looking in the help file of that geom.

You can use stat and geom interchangeably. For example, the default stat for `geom_bar()` is `stat_count()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this code:
ggplot(iris) + 
  stat_count(aes(x = Species))

# is the same as:
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Species))
```


The help file for `geom_bar()` will also document what values are computed for this stat. `stat_count()` computes 2 values: count and prop. 

You can override the default stat with the `stat` argument in `geom_xx()`. You can also change the default mapping e.g. so that a bar graph of proportion is shown instead of counts. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = Species, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

Note that proportion is now on the y axis. The argument `group = 1` means that it will treat all observations as 100% and calculated the proportion of observations in each group. Without this argument, the proportion will be 100% for each group as it will treat each group separately.

## geom_point

The `iris` dataset will be used for this section.

### Jitter

A problem with scatter plots is that if there are many values that are the same number (especially if they are rounded), the points will overlap each other and it will be diff to appreciate from the graph where the weight of the points lie. To overcome this you can separate the points by adding a bit of random noise to each point. You can do this in two ways:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```

or in a shorter way (as `geom_point(position = "jitter")` = `geom_jitter()`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


### Labels

To label points, use `geom_text`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = iris$Species))
```

If you only wanted to label a few specific points, you can use `ifelse()`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(iris$Petal.Length > 6.2, 
                               as.character(iris$Species), "")), 
            hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1)
```

Note that in the `ifelse()` statement, you specify the label to be empty `""` if the value (row) does not meet your condition.

The arguments `hjust` and `vjust` change the position of the label. Note that these are arguments to `geom_text()` and not `aes()`.

Overlapping labels is a common problem. The package `ggrepel` ( [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html) ) solves this problem. 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = ifelse(iris$Petal.Length > 6.2,
                                     as.character(iris$Species), "")))
```

Note that you no longer use `geom_text()`. We also put the label argument within `geom_text_repel(aes())`. You can also the `label` argument within ggplot, so it is set 'globally'.

### Colour points

If you use the aesthetic `fill` to colour points using a categorical variable, ggplot2 will set different colours for each category. If you use a continuous variable, ggplot2 will set a gradient scale with appropriate min and max values. 

To colour specific points you can use `cut()` with `scale_colour_manual()`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length, 
                 colour = cut(iris$Petal.Length, c(0,6,10)))) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "legend", values = c("red", "black"))
```

The function `cut()` divides a vector into intervals. You can either specify break points (as I have above - note providing 3 numbers breaks the vector into 2 intervals) or specify the number of intervals you want, in the `breaks` argument. The result is a factor, where each level is an interval. 

The `scale_colour_manual()` function lets you specify which colours you wish to use. You can also modify the legend by changing the name and the legend labels.

Here we will change the legend labels:
```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length, 
                 colour = cut(iris$Petal.Length, c(0,6,10)))) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "legend", values = c("red", "black"), 
                      labels = c("less than 6", "larger than 6"))
```

You can also do this by calling `geom_point()` twice, specifying only selected points in the second call and setting these points to be a specific colour (see: [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11467965/r-ggplot2-highlighting-selected-points-and-strange-behavior) ).

### Matrix of plots

Base R comes with the function `pairs()` which creates a matrix of scatter plots.

```{r}
pairs(iris[,1:4])
```

The `GGally` package is an extension to `ggplot2` and has a function called `ggpairs()` which offers extra functionality, like letting you use non-continuous variables in your data frames.

```{r, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(iris, aes(colour = Species, alpha = 0.4))
```

### Adding lines

`geom_line()` allows you to add a simple line that joins all the points:

```{r}
ggplot(iris[1:3,], aes(y = Petal.Length, x = Sepal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

To change the appearance of the line, `geom_line()` offers the following arguments:

* colour
* linetype
* size

Setting `linetype` within `geom_line(aes())` allows you have different line types depending on the factor. See [R cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Bar_and_line_graphs_(ggplot2)/) for more details.

`geom_smooth` allows you to fit a smooth line through all the points using various methods. The default is 'auto' which picks one of:

* lm
* glm
* gam
* loess

depending on the size of the largest group. A message will be output along with the plot informing the user of which method was used.

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Petal.Width, x = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

More details can be found in the [ggplot2 reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html).

#### Grouping

You may need to specify `aes(group())` within `geom_line()` if you wish to join lines within groups only.

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(meanSep = mean(Sepal.Length), meanPet = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  gather(2:3, key = 'type', value = 'mean')
```

This will give a warning:
```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(meanSep = mean(Sepal.Length), meanPet = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  gather(2:3, key = 'type', value = 'mean') %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species, colour = type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

Default grouping occurs in two ways:

* If `x` or `y` are categorical variables, this will become the default group
* If `colour`, `shape` or `fill` is used, data will be grouped according to the variable mapped to.

In the above case, `x` was set to `Species` and `colour` to `type` - thus there is only one observation per group, as per the warning message.

There are a few ways to avoid default grouping:

* do not use map in `ggplot(aes())` as this will be applied to all layers
* override the default grouping with the `group` parameter

Here we have overriden the default grouping in the `geom_line()` geom:
```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(meanSep = mean(Sepal.Length), meanPet = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  gather(2:3, key = 'type', value = 'mean') %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species, colour = type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = type))
```


You can also remove all grouping by setting `group` to be a constant - any one value, e.g. 1, or 123, or 'aa'. This makes the `geom` treat all the data as one group and draw one line through all the data points. Note also that you can do this within `aes()` or outside of `aes()` as it is a constant (see section \@ref(aesthetics)).

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(meanSep = mean(Sepal.Length), meanPet = mean(Petal.Length)) %>%
  gather(2:3, key = 'type', value = 'mean') %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species, colour = type)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(group = 1)
```






Finally, note that grouping is for *collective geoms*. Collective geoms are geoms which 'use' more than one row of data. In `geom_point()`, each point is one row of data, thus it is NOT a collective geom. In `geom_boxplo()`, each box uses data from many rows, thus it is a collective geom. Grouping is important for collective geoms but NOT for individual geoms.

(See [link](https://www.gl-li.com/2017/08/13/ggplot2-group-overrides-default-grouping/) for more details)



## Bar graphs & histograms

The default stat of `geom_bar()` is 'count', which ‘bins’ your data (puts each value into a defined ‘bin’), and then plots bin counts. 

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species)) +
  geom_bar()
```


This tells you that there are 50 values (observations/rows) in each species group.

`geom_histogram()` is appropriate for a continuous variable:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```


A message will be output with the plot telling the user which bin width has been used. To pick a binwidth, use the `binwidth` argument in `geom_histogram()` (outside of `aes()`).

A number of histograms can be overlayed on top of each other, though Hadley recommends that you do this with `geom_freqpoly()`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) + 
  geom_freqpoly()
```


To plot a bar graph using absolute values (instead of frequencies), use `stat = 'identity'` (see 888 chapter for dplyr notation):

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```


Adding `fill` argument in `aes()` will create a stacked bar graph:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


Note: `fill` species the colour of the bar (or point) and `colour` spefies the colour of the border around the bar (or point).

To have the bars next to each other instead of stacked, use `position = 'dodge'`:

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
```


Note in the graph above, for lengths where not all species are present, there is only 1 bar that is wider. To fix this - google it...


## geom_boxplot

Definitions:
* A box that stretches from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile
* A line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the farthest non-outlier point in the distribution.
* Points (dots) that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the IQR from either edge of the box. These outlying points are unusual so are plotted individually.

## Facets

(Back to the `mpg` dataset)

Another way to add variables is to split into many graphs:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(. ~ class, nrow = 2) # same plot with or without dot
```

The first argument is a ‘formula’, which you create with `~` followed by variable name. Variable should not be a continuous variable. In the above plot, leaving one side empty or using a dot means that only one variable is being facetted. The `nrow` and `ncol` arguments let you specify how many rows or columns you want.

If you wish to facet using two variables, `facet_wrap` will look like this:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(drv ~ class, nrow = 2) # same plot with or without dot
```

Graphs for all possible combinations of your two variables are created and arranged as per the `nrow` and `ncol` specification - as described by the help file: 'Wrap a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d'.
Note that only combinations where there values are shown.

Alternatively you can use `facet_grid()`:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```


Here the notation is `(row ~ column)` - LHS is which variable should be horizontally facetted and RHS is which variable should be vertically facetted.

Note that in this case graphs for all possible combinations of the two variables are created, even though some combinations have no values (e.g. the botton left graphs have no points in them).


## Reordering factors

Often a specific order of factor levels is desired when plotting. This can be achieved using the base R function `reorder()`.

```{r}
head(
reorder(mpg$manufacturer, mpg$displ, FUN = max),
n=20
)
```

In the above code we have reordered the levels of `mpg$manufacturer` according to the maximum `mpg$displ` (engine displacement in litres) value of each factor group. See the `reorder` help file for more details.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median), y = hwy))
```

In the above graph, we have reordered the levels of `mpg$class` according to their median hwy levels. You acn see in the boxplot, that the median hwy levels increase from left to right.

## Coordinate systems

Default is Cartesian.

`coord_flip()` switches axis of the graph - rotatwa graph by 90 deg. Good for graphs with long names on the x-axis.
`coord_cartesian(ylim = c(min,max), xlim = c(min,max))` lets you 'zoom' in on a particular part of the graph.

## Reference lines

Reference lines can be added to graphs using:

* `geom_abline` - diagonal specified by slope and intercept (vertical and horizontal lines can also be drawn)
* `geom_hline` - horizontal line
* `geom_vline` - vertical line

See [ggplot reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html) for examples.

## Error bars

To add error bars, you must specify the length of each error bar. For example, if you wished to have +/- standard deviation error bars on a bar graph, you need to have a column in your dataframe with the standard deviation for each bar.

If we wanted to plot the mean +/- sd of the Sepal.Length we would need a dataframe with these columns:
```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Length), sd = sd(Sepal.Length)) 
```

To add the error bars, use `geom_errorbar()`:

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Length), sd = sd(Sepal.Length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd))
```

To change the appearance of the error bar, there are many options:

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(Sepal.Length), sd = sd(Sepal.Length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x = Species)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - sd, ymax = mean + sd),
                size = 0.3, # thinner lines
                width = 0.2, # how much of the bar the error bar should span
                position = position_dodge(0.9)
                )

```

`position_dodge()` preserves the vertical position of an geom while adjusting the horizontal position.
(see [ggplot ref](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_dodge.html)  for more details)

For more examples see [R cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Plotting_means_and_error_bars_(ggplot2)/).

## Appearance

* Change axis name and title: `labs(title = "MAIN TITLE", x = "X-AXIS TITLE", y = "Y-AXIS TITLE")`.
* Change position of title: `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))`.
* Set which categories appear in barplot/boxplot: `xlim("Category1","Category2")`.
* Change colour of `fill` boxplot/bars: `scale_fill_manual(values = c("Colour1", "Colour2"), name = "title of Legend", labels = c("Label1","Label2"))`.
* Change names under each bar/boxplot: `scale_x_discrete(labels = c("bar1", "bar2", "bar3", "bar4"))`.
* Change title text style: `theme(title = element_text(face = "bold.italic", color = "blue", size = 16))`.
* Change axis name text style: `theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold.italic", color = "red", size = 16))`.
* Legend title/labels: `scale_fill_discrete(name = "Legend name", labels = c())`.
* Angle of labels: `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))`.

## dplyr & ggplot2

To make a plot for each `group_by()`, use `do()`. See 888 for more details.

```{r}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  do(plots=ggplot(data=.) +
         aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length) +
       geom_point() +
       ggtitle(unique(.$Species))
     )

```

The output of this is a dataframe where the first column gives the names of the groups (from the `group_by()`) and the second column is called ‘plots’ (as we specified) and each item is a plot (`gg` object).

To give the plot a title - the name of the group - you can either use:

* `unique(.$Species)` - there will only be 1 species type after `group_by()`.
* `.$Species[1]` - this is the first row of the Species column after `group_by()`.

## Saving graphs

Using `pdf()` or `png()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf(‘name of thing.pdf’)
 
# Generate your plot

dev.off() # this closes off the current graphic device
```


`ggsave()` saves the last plot that you generated. You can specify `width`, `height` and  `units` - options are `c('in', 'cm', 'mm')`.
