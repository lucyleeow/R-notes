drop

Drop = Drop Redundant Extent Information
Delete the dimensions of an array which have only one level.

When subsetting to get only 1 row/column (from a matrix/array), you can set drop=TRUE to get a vector.
If drop=FALSE, you get the same data structure, but with just 1 row

### logicals

```{r}
12 | 3
```

This is evaluated to be TRUE because if you coerce a number into a logical, any non-zero number will be TRUE and 0 will be FALSE.

```{r}
as.logical(0)
```

```{r}
as.logical(-3)
```

Thus `12 | 3` is essentially `TRUE | TRUE` which is `TRUE`.
